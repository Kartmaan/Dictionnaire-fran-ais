# French language tools
Series of tools using a French dictionary in .csv format.
The file contains +900,000 words with their spelling variations, their plurals, their conjugations etc. as well as their definitions, also in French. It was generated in Python on the basis of an XML file containing the database of fr.wiktionary and according to methods explained in detail in the "Upstream" folder, the XML not being in the final git due to its significant weight.

The .csv dataset was also published on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartmaan/dictionnaire-francais
